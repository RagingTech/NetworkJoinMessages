A modern continuation of [BungeeJoinMessages](https://github.com/Tirco/BungeeJoinMessages), this plugin handles customizable join, leave, and server-swap messages across proxy servers like BungeeCord and Velocity.

## Features
- Flexible joining, leaving, and server-swapping notifications
- Compatible with BungeeCord and Velocity proxy setups
- Easy-to-use configuration with powerful placeholder support
  - [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/) (prefix and suffix)
  - [PAPIProxyBridge](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/papiproxybridge.108415/)
  - [MiniPlaceholders](https://modrinth.com/plugin/miniplaceholders)
- Support for legacy and MiniMessage formatting
- Support for [PremiumVanish](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/premiumvanish-stay-hidden-bungee-velocity-support.14404/) and [LimboAPI](https://github.com/Elytrium/LimboAPI)

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/118643/)
2. Place the JAR file in the `plugins` directory of your proxy server
3. Restart the proxy to generate the default configuration
4. Edit the `config.yml` file in the plugin's directory to your liking following changes with `/njoinreload`
5. Optionally, configure Discord messages in the `discord.yml` file also following changes with `/njoinreload`

> [!NOTE]
> If you want the vanilla join/leave messages to go away, you can remove them with [EssentialsX](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html), or use [this](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/join-and-leave-message-disabler.88850/) basic plugin.

## Placeholders

Buit-in placeholders are described below. As mentioned before, PlaceholderAPI placeholders are supported given the PAPIProxyBridge plugin is on the proxy and backend servers. MiniPlaceholders are also supported given the MiniPlaceholders plugin is on the proxy.

### Any of the three message types:

- _%player%_ Player username
- _%displayname%_ Custom name the player has according to the proxy
- _%player_prefix%_ Player prefix (requires LuckPerms on the proxy)
- _%player_suffix%_ Player suffix (requires LuckPerms on the proxy)

### Swap server message:

- _%to%_ The server they are going to
- _%to_clean%_ ^ Same, but with color codes removed.
- _%from%_ The server they are coming from
- _%from_clean%_ ^ Same, but with color codes removed.
- _%playercount_to%_ The amount of players on the server they going to.
- _%playercount_from%_ The amount of players on the server they are coming from.
- _%playercount_network%_ The amount of players on the network.

### Join & leave network messages:
- _%server_name%_ The name of the server they joined to or was last on when they left.
- _%server_name_clean%_ ^ Same, but with color codes removed.
- _%playercount_server%_ The amount of players on the server they connected to, or was last on when they left.
- _%playercount_network%_ The amount of players on their network.

> [!TIP]
> Remember that the command `/njoinreload` can be used to reload the messages without having to restart the server. Requires the networkjoinmessages.reload permission.
